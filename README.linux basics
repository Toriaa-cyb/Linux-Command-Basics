# Linux-Command-Basics
i started learning Ethical hacking because i was tired of learning the theoritical stuff but once i started learning ethical hacking, 
it dawned on me that i did not know how to use my linux terminal at all!
so i went all the way back and got a free textbook course from the Aquila Community which i am currently using had in hand with my Ethical hacking course from Udemy
